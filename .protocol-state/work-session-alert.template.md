## ⚠️ Extended Work Session Detected

You have been working on {PROJECT_NAME} for {DURATION}. Prolonged sessions can lead to:
- Fatigue and reduced focus
- Increased risk of errors
- Burnout and decreased productivity
- Poor decision-making and technical debt accumulation

### Recommended Actions

1. **Save your progress now.**
   - Commit your current work to git
   - Document your stopping point
   - Note any pending tasks or blockers

2. **Take a short break** (5–15 minutes minimum)
   - Stretch and move away from your desk
   - Hydrate and grab a healthy snack
   - Clear your mind before resuming

3. **Assess your energy level**
   - If fatigued, consider ending the session
   - Schedule a fresh start when well-rested
   - Quality > quantity—tired code is buggy code

> _Tip: Use this time to stretch, hydrate, and clear your mind before resuming work._

## 📊 Session Context

**Work Duration**: {DURATION}
**Late Night Work**: {LATE_NIGHT_FLAG}
**Continuous Work**: {CONTINUOUS_FLAG}
**Break Recommendation**: {BREAK_RECOMMENDATION}

### Why This Matters

Research consistently shows that:
- Productivity drops significantly after 4 hours of continuous focused work
- Error rates increase exponentially when fatigued
- Late-night coding sessions create more bugs than they fix
- Regular breaks improve overall code quality and project velocity

**Sustainable productivity beats burnout-driven sprints every time.**
