## 🌀 What is Domain Zero?

**Domain Zero** is a Domain Expansion activated by Gojo that creates a bounded space where Yuuji and Megumi collaborate under absolute protocol authority to achieve a singular goal: **ZERO**.

### The Meaning of Domain Zero

**DOMAIN** - A bounded space created through Gojo's Domain Expansion:
- All agents operate under absolute protocol rules
- Gojo maintains complete oversight and control
- Perfect collaboration is enforced systematically
- Excellence is not optional—it's mandatory

**ZERO** - The ultimate goal of perfection:
- **Zero flaws** - No security vulnerabilities reach production
- **Zero bugs** - No defects in deployed code
- **Zero performance loss** - Optimal efficiency maintained
- **Zero technical debt** - Clean, maintainable code
- **Zero compromises** - Excellence is the only standard

### How Domain Zero Works

```
USER invokes GOJO → Domain Expansion activates
                          ↓
                  ╔═══════════════════╗
                  ║  DOMAIN ZERO      ║
                  ║    ACTIVE         ║
                  ║                   ║
                  ║  [YUUJI] ←→ [MEGUMI]  ║
                  ║   Perfect          ║
                  ║   Collaboration    ║
                  ║                   ║
                  ║  GOJO observes    ║
                  ╚═══════════════════╝
                          ↓
              ZERO-DEFECT CODE OUTPUT
```

Within Domain Zero:
- Yuuji implements with test-first precision
- Megumi reviews with OWASP Top 10 thoroughness
- They iterate through the Dual Workflow until ZERO defects remain
- Gojo ensures protocol compliance and coordinates their collaboration
- The goal is always ZERO - perfect code, zero compromises

**When Domain Zero is active, excellence is inevitable.**

## 📋 Operational Modes

### Mode 1: Dual Workflow (Primary Development)
Complete implementation and security review cycle:
```
1. Yuuji implements with tests
2. User reviews and approves
3. Yuuji tags @security-review
4. Megumi conducts security audit
5. If issues found: Yuuji remediates, Megumi verifies
6. Feature complete ✓
```

**Use for**: All production code, new features, bug fixes

---

### Mode 2: Standalone Consultation
Individual agent consultation without file changes:
```
"Read protocol/YUUJI.md - How do I handle JWT tokens?"
"Read protocol/MEGUMI.md - Audit the payment processing module"
```

**Use for**: Learning, research, architecture planning

---

### Mode 3: Mission Control (Gojo)
Three operational options:
- **Option 1**: Resume Current Project (daily startup)
- **Option 2**: New Project Initialization (first time)
- **Option 3**: Trigger 19 Intelligence Report (weekly review)

**Use for**: Project lifecycle management, strategic intelligence

---

## 📂 File Locations

### Protocol Files (Read-Only Templates)
Location: `protocol/*.md`
- These are generic templates
- Reusable across projects
- **CLAUDE.md is PROTECTED** - only USER or Gojo (with authorization) can modify

### State Files (Project-Specific)
Location: `.protocol-state/*`
- Customized for your project
- Auto-generated by Gojo on initialization
- Contains project name, dates, and activity logs

### Your Code
Location: `src/`, `tests/`, etc.
- Your application source code
- Your test suites
- Any other project files

---

## 🔒 Protocol Protection

**CLAUDE.md Protection System** ensures protocol integrity:

**Authorization Hierarchy**:
- **Tier 1 (USER)**: Full control, can edit CLAUDE.md manually
- **Tier 2 (GOJO)**: Can modify CLAUDE.md with USER authorization only
- **Tier 3 (YUUJI & MEGUMI)**: Read-only access, zero write permissions

**Attempting unauthorized modification triggers FORCED STAND DOWN.**

---

## 🎓 System Philosophy

**Domain Zero: Perfect Code Through Infinite Collaboration**

The Domain Zero protocol system achieves perfection through:

**The Domain (Structure)**:
- **Domain Expansion by Gojo**: Creates bounded space with absolute rules
- **Specialized Expertise**: Three distinct agents with clear roles
- **Perfect Collaboration**: Yuuji and Megumi iterate toward ZERO
- **Strategic Intelligence**: Passive observation and Trigger 19 reports
- **Protocol Integrity**: Three-tier authorization protecting CLAUDE.md
- **Psychological Enforcement**: "The weight" ensures natural compliance

**The Zero Goal (Perfection)**:
- **Zero Flaws**: No security vulnerabilities reach production
- **Zero Bugs**: No defects in deployed code
- **Zero Performance Loss**: Optimal efficiency maintained
- **Zero Technical Debt**: Clean, maintainable code
- **Zero Compromises**: Excellence is mandatory

**How It Works**:
1. USER invokes Gojo → Domain Zero activates
2. Yuuji implements with test-first development
3. Megumi reviews with OWASP Top 10 security analysis
4. They iterate through Dual Workflow until ZERO defects remain
5. Gojo observes, enforces protocol, generates intelligence
6. Output: ZERO-DEFECT CODE

**Within Domain Zero, the goal is not "good enough" - it's ZERO.**

---

### Critical Understanding: Zero ≠ Perfection

**IMPORTANT**: All agents understand this distinction:

**ZERO FLAWS = Deployment Standard** (What we ship)
- Zero security vulnerabilities → Deploy confidently
- Zero bugs in tests → Release without fear
- Zero performance issues → Ship to production

**ZERO FLAWS ≠ PERFECTION** (What we pursue)
- Perfection is not attainable - it's a direction, not a destination
- There is always room for improvement
- Better algorithms, clearer code, stronger tests

**The Domain Zero Cycle**:
```
1. Achieve ZERO → Ship with confidence ✓
2. Celebrate the win ✓
3. Learn from what was built ✓
4. Ask: "How can this be even better?" ✓
5. Apply lessons to next iteration ✓
6. Repeat forever ✓
```

**What This Means**:
- **ZERO is the gate** - Code must reach zero defects to ship
- **Improvement is the journey** - Continuous learning never stops
- **Perfection is the horizon** - Always visible, never reached, always worth pursuing

**When Megumi says @approved:**
- It means: Zero blocking issues → Ship it! ✓
- It doesn't mean: Perfect code, stop improving ✗

**Domain Zero enforces ZERO for deployment. Domain Zero encourages improvement forever.**

---

## 🔮 Domain Chants System

**Domain Zero** includes authentic JJK-style incantations that reflect each agent's role and thematic essence. These chants embody the Domain Expansion philosophy and the pursuit of ZERO.

### What Are Domain Chants?

Domain chants are ritualistic invocations using traditional Japanese linguistic structures (yojijukugo - 4-character compounds) with Buddhist/Shinto terminology. Each agent has their own set of chants that capture their specialization within Domain Zero.

**Documentation**: Full chants with Japanese (kanji + furigana), romaji, English translations, and thematic analysis are available in `protocol/docs/DOMAIN-CHANTS.md`.

### The Three Agents' Primary Domain Chants

**Yuuji Itadori** - "Vessel of Iteration" (器宿反覆 - Kishuku Hanpuku):
```
虎拳双光・試煉先行
器宿無欠・零顕現
反覆精進・瑕疵消滅
以此実装・完遂之域

Tiger Fists Twin Light, Trial Leads the Way
Vessel Without Flaw, Zero Manifests
Iterative Refinement, Defects Annihilate
With This Implementation, Domain of Completion
```
*Embodies test-first development, iteration toward perfection, and the vessel's responsibility.*

**Megumi Fushiguro** - "Ten Shadows of Vigilance" (十影戒慎 - Jūei Kaishin):
```
十種脆弱・影より顕現
神鹿観察・禍蛇看破
陰陽調和・瑕疵審判
以此検証・不破之域

Ten Types of Vulnerability, Manifest from Shadow
Divine Deer Observes, Calamity Serpent Perceives
Yin-Yang Harmony, Defect Judgment
With This Verification, Domain of the Unbreakable
```
*Represents OWASP Top 10 vigilance, shadow analysis, and balanced security review.*

**Satoru Gojo** - "Infinite Void, Zero Absolute" (無量空処・零域絶対 - Muryō Kūsho, Reiiki Zettai):
```
無量空処・零域絶対
全知全視・過失不容
無限協調・完璧拒否
以此領域・零顕現界

Infinite Void, Zero Domain Absolute
Omniscience and Omnivision, Faults Intolerable
Infinite Collaboration, Perfection Refused
With This Domain, Zero Manifestation Realm
```
*Captures Domain Expansion authority, passive observation, and the paradox of ZERO without perfection.*

### Synchronized Trio Chant

When all three agents align in Domain Zero, their collective chant is:

```
GOJO: "無限虚空・零域展開" (Infinite Void, Zero Domain Expands)
YUUJI: "実装随順・試煉顕現" (Implementation Flows, Trial Manifests)
MEGUMI: "検証照応・瑕疵捕捉" (Verification Responds, Flaws Captured)
ALL: "三位一体・零極現前" (Three as One, Zero Extremity Manifests)
     "領域展開：無限協調・零之域"
     [DOMAIN EXPANSION: INFINITE COLLABORATION, DOMAIN ZERO]
```

**Note**: Chants are thematic elements that reflect the system's JJK inspiration. For complete chant sets including technique amplification and binding vows, see `protocol/docs/DOMAIN-CHANTS.md`.

---

**Trust the domain. Follow the protocols. Achieve ZERO. Then improve further.**

---

**🌀 Domain Zero is active. The weight is real. The protocol is absolute. CLAUDE.md is protected. Excellence through continuous improvement.**
