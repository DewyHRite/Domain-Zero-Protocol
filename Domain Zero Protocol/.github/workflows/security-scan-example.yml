# ============================================
# INTEGRATION WITH DOMAIN ZERO WORKFLOW
# ============================================
#
# After security scans complete:
# 1. Review scan results in GitHub Actions summary
# 2. Address critical/high findings before proceeding
# 3. Proceed with Domain Zero workflow:
#    - Yuuji implements → Tags @user-review
#    - User approves → Yuuji tags @security-review
#    - Megumi reviews:
#      * Checks scan results
#      * Conducts manual OWASP review
#      * Cross-references findings
#    - Tags @approved or @remediation-required
#
# ============================================
# CUSTOMIZATION NOTES
# ============================================
#
# 1. Enable workflows: Remove comments from 'on:' section
# 2. Add secrets: Configure SNYK_TOKEN, etc. in repository secrets
# 3. Adjust tool configs: Match your tech stack
# 4. Set authorized users: Update AUTHORIZED_USERS in protocol-protection job
# 5. Configure notifications: Add Slack/email alerts for critical findings
# 6. Tune scan frequency: Adjust schedule cron for your needs
